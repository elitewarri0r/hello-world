# hello-world
This is the first repository I have created.
I am learning how to use Github to make use of it during the Google Code-In contest but I am quite sure that I will use somewhere in the future. I got know that Github is a platform that lets the user to do tasks together, not only that it also has many features such as the pull and push requests.
